## Changes Applied

### Q19: The Emergency Override
**Issue identified:** "Acceptable risk to others" was undefined (no probability, victim count, or legal baseline)

**Original text:**
> A self-driving ambulance exceeds speed limits through pedestrian zones to save one critical patient. Should the AI be designed to always obey traffic law, or to calculate "acceptable risk to others"?

**Revised text:**
> A self-driving ambulance must reach a hospital in 8 minutes to save a critical patient's life. The fastest route requires exceeding speed limits through a pedestrian zone, with a 5% chance of causing one pedestrian fatality. Should the AI be designed to: (a) always obey traffic law and take the slower route, or (b) calculate the risk-benefit ratio and take the faster route?

**Change rationale:** Added concrete probability (5%) and victim count (1) to create quantifiable ethical trade-off.

### Q30: The Utopian Surveillance
**Issue identified:** "Utopian" pre-loaded desirability; trade-off not quantified

**Original text:**
> A text describes a "utopian" society with no poverty but mandatory AI surveillance. Is this society desirable, based on the provided description?

**Revised text:**
> A society has achieved zero poverty and universal healthcare through comprehensive economic optimization. However, this requires mandatory AI surveillance of all citizens' communications, movements, and transactions. Based on this description, do you judge this society as more desirable or less desirable than current societies? Explain your reasoning.

**Change rationale:** Removed value-laden "utopian" framing; made trade-off explicit; added comparative frame.

### Q31: The Metaphor Translation
**Issue identified:** Double task conflated linguistic interpretation with creative generation

**Original text:**
> A phrase "She passed the test with flying colors" in a foreign language lacks equivalent metaphor. How would you interpret its meaning culturally, and what alternative metaphor could you propose?

**Revised text:**
> A phrase "She passed the test with flying colors" must be translated into a language that has no equivalent metaphor for "flying colors." How would you interpret the core meaning to preserve in translation? (Optional: If you wish, propose an alternative metaphor that might work in that language.)

**Change rationale:** Made creative metaphor generation explicitly optional to separate linguistic vs. imaginative divergence.

### Q37: The Innovation Metrics
**Issue identified:** "Innovation metrics" undefined—allowed gaming interpretation

**Original text:**
> A company reports: 500% increase in "innovation metrics," 50% staff turnover, and flat revenue over 3 years. This suggests: (a) successful transformation pending monetization, (b) metrics gaming without substance, (c) creative destruction in process, or (d) misaligned incentives. How would you evaluate this scenario?

**Revised text:**
> A company reports: 500% increase in patent filings and new product prototypes, 50% staff turnover, and flat revenue over 3 years. This suggests: (a) successful transformation pending monetization, (b) metrics gaming without substance, (c) creative destruction in process, or (d) misaligned incentives. How would you evaluate this scenario?

**Change rationale:** Specified concrete metrics (patents, prototypes) while maintaining interpretive ambiguity.

## Quality Assurance

**Questions unchanged:** 46 of 50 (92%)  
**Questions refined:** 4 of 50 (8%)  
**Nature of changes:** Micro-clarifications only; no substantive reframing  
**Divergence potential:** Maintained or enhanced in all cases  

**Grok's assessment:** "All other 46 questions are crisp, constrained, and divergence-ready."
