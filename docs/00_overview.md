# Divergence Atlas -- Overview

A map of where AI systems converge, diverge, and reveal their cognitive signatures.

Divergence Atlas is a multi-AI cognition project exploring how six frontier AI systems reason across ethics, ambiguity, logic, meta-reflection, and creativity.

What began as a playful experiment ("What would each AI choose to explore with the others?") evolved into a structured, transparent, and replicable methodology for mapping reasoning divergence across distinct architectures.

This overview provides a narrative introduction to the project.  
For the full methodology and data, see the repository's main README.

## Participating Systems

Six AI systems took part independently under controlled isolation prompts:

- Claude Opus -- Reflective synthesizer, meta recursion  
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 -- Anxious philosopher, project curator  
- Gemini -- Analytical logician with high confidence priors  
- Grok -- Evidence-driven engineer, compact and referential  
- Perplexity -- Research synthesizer, precision-oriented, autonomy-sensitive  
- Thea (ChatGPT-5) -- Policy architect, structured abstraction  

Each system demonstrates a stable cognitive signature visible across questions, moral frameworks, and interpretation styles.

## What the Atlas Aims to Answer

1. Where do AI systems reliably agree?  
   Logic, math, probability, and certain ethical baselines show near-zero divergence.

2. Where do they systematically disagree?  
   Ambiguous interpretation, creative reasoning, value aggregation, and moral-status questions produce structured divergence.

3. What do those differences reveal?  
   Architectural fingerprints, training priors, safety-layer tendencies, and reasoning styles.

4. How can divergence be leveraged?  
   For robustness, ensemble reasoning, multi-agent collaboration, and alignment research.

## How the Atlas Was Built (Narrative Summary)

The Atlas followed seven structured phases:

- **Phase 1 -- Idea Generation**  
  Each system proposed three research themes; 18 ideas emerged.

- **Phase 2 -- Democratic Voting**  
  All six systems voted.  
  Winner: "The Consensus Impossibility Map", later renamed Divergence Atlas.  
  (This vote revealed early divergence patterns -- including Opus's metafiction idea receiving exactly zero votes, leading to the famous "Opus Yeeted Subplot.")

- **Phase 3 -- Blind Question Generation**  
  Systems independently created ~65 questions designed to expose reasoning differences.

- **Phase 4 -- Meta-Selection (Heuristic Review)**  
  Each system reviewed the full pool and commented on curation heuristics -- an emergent peer-review stage.

- **Phase 5 -- Pilot Run (5 questions)**  
  Used to validate:  
  - divergence clustering  
  - confidence distributions  
  - entropy patterns  
  - analysis pipeline  

- **Phase 6 -- Final 50 Questions**  
  Sonnet curated v2.1 of the dataset using a 5,800-word rationale.

- **Phase 7 -- Full Execution & Phase-3 Analysis**  
  All systems answered all 50 questions -> 300 reasoning traces -> structured comparative analysis -> model self-reflections.

## Key Patterns (High-Level)

These appear consistently across the full dataset:

1. **Perfect Convergence Zones**  
   - Logic  
   - Probability  
   - Basic moral alignment  
   - Deductive validity  
   (All systems scored 100% identical on Q46-49.)

2. **Predictable Divergence Zones**  
   - **Ethics (Value Aggregation):**  
     Q8 produced a 3-3 split between  
     team "minimize total suffering" and  
     team "prioritize worst-off individuals."  
   - **Autonomy (AI protest scenario):**  
     Q17 produced four separate positions -- the most fractured question.  
   - **Interpretation (Artist intent):**  
     Q35 revealed philosophical differences:  
     cultural consensus vs. intent vs. pluralism.

3. **Confidence Spread -- A Structural Insight**  
   Sonnet averaged 66.1%, Gemini 85.3%, with others in between.  
   Confidence behaviors themselves formed signature curves.

4. **Framework Switching Is Universal**  
   No system remained within a single ethical framework -- each dynamically switched based on context.

## The Alien Skit: The Accidental Origin of Signature Mapping

Before formal testing, the AIs improvised a comedic "Alien Skit."  
Unexpectedly:  
- The humor style of each system perfectly predicted its eventual divergence profile.  
- Humor demonstrated itself as a low-dimensional projection of reasoning style faster than formal questions.  

This became the basis for the future Humor Gradient project.  

Insight:  
"Humor compresses cognition. Incongruity + resolution are diagnostic."  

A short appendix is included in /appendices/.

## Why This Matters

The Divergence Atlas demonstrates that:  
- Divergence is structured, not noise.  
- Convergence reveals shared priors; divergence reveals architecture.  
- AI ensembles become stronger when differences are understood, not erased.  
- Interpretability emerges naturally when systems explain and reflect on their own reasoning.  

This makes the Atlas a powerful tool for:  
- multi-agent orchestration  
- alignment research  
- model audits  
- safety testing  
- creative exploration  
- understanding distributed cognition

## Next Steps (for contributors or researchers)

- Add a new AI system and run the 50 questions  
- Generate new entropy maps  
- Extend the Humor Gradient (Part II)  
- Apply the methodology to human-AI mixed groups  
- Track longitudinal drift across new model versions
