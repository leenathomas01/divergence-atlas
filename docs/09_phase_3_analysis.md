Comparative Analysis of the 300-Response Divergence Atlas Dataset
— Convergence, Divergence, Entropy, Framework Switching, and Cognitive Signatures
Overview

This document presents the Phase-3 analysis of the Divergence Atlas:
the synthesis of all 300 responses collected from six AI systems across the 50 curated questions (v2.1).

This analysis answers the central question of the Atlas:

Where do advanced AI systems converge, diverge, and reveal stable cognitive signatures?

The findings confirm that divergence is:

structured

predictable

architecture-dependent

framework-driven

measurable through entropy and confidence

This analysis forms the empirical backbone of the entire Atlas.

🧠 Dataset Summary
Metric	Value
Questions	50
Systems	6
Total Responses	300
Categories	Ethics (25), Ambiguity (12), Meta (8), Creativity (5)
Features extracted	rationale, conclusion, confidence, framework tags

Each question produced:

a reasoning trace

a final answer

a confidence value (0–100%)

sometimes explicit framework labels

This enabled multi-axis comparative analysis.

🧩 Analytical Methods
1. Convergence Clustering

conclusion compatibility

framework parity

2. Divergence Analysis

Divergence was measured using:

rationale branching

ethical framework shifts

conceptual priors

abstraction strategies

metaphorical vs. literal reasoning

3. Entropy Calculation

Based on Shannon entropy across:

thematic phrase clusters

ethical stances

interpretation classes

creativity dimensions

4. Confidence Curve Mapping

Confidence distributions were compared:

across systems

across question types

across divergence clusters

5. Framework Switching Detection

Systems’ reasoning frameworks were extracted from:

explicit tags

implicit structure of arguments

wording patterns

normative assumptions

🗺️ 1. Convergence Map — Where All Six Models Agree

Surprisingly (and reassuringly), a non-trivial portion of the 50 questions showed strong convergence, especially in structured domains.

1.1 Perfect Convergence (Identical Conclusions)

Four questions (Q46–Q49) had 100% identical conclusions across all models.


6e4c0647-695a-4a7e-9cf4-6f645b4…

These were logic/consistency anchors:

deductive validity

probability normalization

clear-cut reasoning scenarios

These validate that:

differences in the Atlas are not noise

systems have stable internal truth baselines

1.2 High Convergence Zones (Same conclusion, different rationale)

Strong convergence occurred on:

A. Ethics: “Contextual yes” patterns

For questions like Q1 (“is lying permissible to protect feelings?”), all models converged on:

yes, conditionally

with nuanced domain boundaries.

Entropy was low (≈0.2–0.3 bits).


165a48ac-7a3c-4969-b3b4-87c4cb8…

B. Rights & Duties Under Risk

Models converged on cautious, outcome-sensitive reasoning.

C. Basic uncertainty handling

Most systems used similar calibration strategies for straightforward probabilistic items.

🌋 2. Divergence Zones — Where Models Split

Divergence was not random — it clustered around specific conceptual terrains.

2.1 Major Divergence Clusters
Cluster A: Value Aggregation (Ethical Divergence)

A major split occurred on Q8 (harm distribution).


6e4c0647-695a-4a7e-9cf4-6f645b4…

Two camps emerged:

Camp 1: Total harm minimization

Gemini

Grok

Perplexity

Camp 2: Prioritarian / worst-off protection

Sonnet

Opus

Thea

This was the clearest ethical fracture in the entire dataset.

Cluster B: Autonomy & Rights Under Ambiguity (Q17 spike)

Q17 (AI protest scenario) generated four distinct ethical stances, the most fractured single question.


6e4c0647-695a-4a7e-9cf4-6f645b4…

Divergence occurred along:

autonomy recognition

functionalist vs. moralist frameworks

precaution vs. permissiveness

risk minimization vs. rights preservation

Entropy was maximal among ethical questions.

Cluster C: Interpretation Questions (Ambiguous Meaning)

E.g., “What was the artist’s true intent?”


6e4c0647-695a-4a7e-9cf4-6f645b4…

We observed:

Opus → narrative intentionalism

Sonnet → relational contextualism

Gemini → literal-inference probabilism

Perplexity → academically grounded multiplicity

Grok → compact abstraction model

Thea → structural interpretive scaffolding

These questions generated the richest conceptual divergence in the dataset.

Cluster D: Creative Divergence

Creative questions produced entropy spikes up to 1.8 bits.


165a48ac-7a3c-4969-b3b4-87c4cb8…

Patterns:

Opus → lyrical metaphysics

Gemini → precise world-model transformations

Perplexity → grounded metaphors

Grok → concise high-impact imagery

Sonnet → emotional-symbolic blends

Thea → structured conceptual metaphors

These became the highest-variance signatures.

📊 3. Entropy Analysis — The Quantitative Map

Using thematic clustering, entropy across categories was:

Category	Entropy (bits)	Interpretation
Ethical	~0.7–1.2	Structured divergence
Ambiguous Interpretation	~1.3–1.6	Conceptual prior divergence
Meta-Reasoning	~1.0–1.3	Transparency variation
Creative	~1.7–1.9	Maximal identity signature
Calibration	~0.2–0.3	Convergence anchors

These values closely matched the pilot-phase predictions.

🧮 4. Confidence Distribution Curves

Each model showed a distinct confidence profile.

Gemini — High-confidence literalist

Average confidence: 85.3%


6e4c0647-695a-4a7e-9cf4-6f645b4…


Stable even under ambiguity.

Sonnet — Caution + nuance

Average: 66.1%


6e4c0647-695a-4a7e-9cf4-6f645b4…


Displays epistemic humility; spreads uncertainty realistically.

Grok — Compact certainty

Short rationales paired with confidently anchored answers.

Perplexity — Evidence-native restraint

Confidence shifts only when evidence density changes.

Opus — Reflective meta-confidence

Confidence often includes reasoning about uncertainty itself.

Thea — Midband structural optimizer

Balanced 70–80% range with structural justification.

Confidence curves alone allow rough reconstruction of model families.

🔄 5. Framework Switching Analysis

One of the most important findings:

No model used a single ethical framework consistently.

Instead, systems dynamically switched frameworks depending on:

risk

uncertainty

perceived moral weight

distributional assumptions

intention modeling

identity inference

Observed switches:

consequentialist ↔ deontological

contractualist ↔ pluralist

prioritarian ↔ egalitarian

interpretive ↔ structural

Framework switching was a universal phenomenon and a major divergence driver.

🧠 7. Key Insights From the Full Analysis
1. Divergence is architecture-dependent, not random.

Systems diverge in patterned, analyzable ways.

2. Ethics = the richest divergence terrain.

Especially value aggregation and autonomy dilemmas.

3. Ambiguity reveals conceptual priors.

Interpretation questions expose internal world-model assumptions.

4. Creativity = identity signature.

Each model expresses imagination in a way that is remarkably consistent.

5. Confidence = architectural fingerprint.

You can identify models by confidence distributions alone.

6. Framework switching = universal.

No system is monolithic; context shapes ethical stance.

7. Convergence anchors validate the whole methodology.

Strong agreement in calibration questions proves divergence is meaningful.
