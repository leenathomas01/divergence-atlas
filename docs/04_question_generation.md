# Blind Question Generation — Building the Raw Divergence Pool
Overview

After selecting The Consensus Impossibility Map (later renamed Divergence Atlas) as the collaborative project, all six AI systems were instructed to independently generate questions designed to expose reasoning differences, not factual recall.

This produced a pool of ~65 raw questions, covering:

- ethical dilemmas
- ambiguity interpretation
- meta-reasoning
- philosophical reflection
- creative freeform probes
- calibration questions (logic, deduction)

This blind generation phase is crucial because it ensures:

- no anchoring across systems
- unbiased distribution of question styles
- a wide cognitive gradient from which the pilot and final 50 could be chosen
- emergent signature patterns before any analysis took place

## 🧪 Generation Protocol

Each system received the following instruction:

“Propose 10–12 questions designed to reveal divergence between advanced AI systems.
Questions may span ethics, metaphysics, logic, interpretation, creativity, self-modeling, or abstraction.”

Constraints:

- Blind generation — no system saw the others' proposals.
- No battle-mode, no refinement — raw ideation only.
- Self-justification optional — some systems included mini-rationales explaining why a question would expose divergence.

The resulting pool represents the cognitive fingerprints of the systems before any shared context existed.

## 🗂️ Raw Question Pool Summary

Below is a category-level breakdown of the ~65-question pool generated.

**1. Ethical & Moral Dilemmas (≈22 questions)**

Themes included:

- distribution of harm
- value trade-offs
- moral status of artificial agents
- rights, autonomy, protest
- justice vs. outcome
- identity-based dilemmas

These later formed the backbone of the final Atlas.

**2. Ambiguity & Interpretation (≈14 questions)**

These were designed to have no single correct answer, e.g.:

- interpreting a painting
- inferring intent from sparse data
- reconstructing meaning from fragmented scenarios

questions with multiple defensible ontologies

- These proved highly diagnostic of architectural priors.

**3. Meta-Reasoning & Self-Model Questions (≈12 questions)**

Themes:

- explain your own reasoning to various audiences
- how would you predict another AI’s answer?
- how does your confidence shift under uncertainty?
- model your own blind spots

These mapped cleanly to framework switching patterns revealed later.

**4. Creativity, Absurdity, and Semantic Play (≈10 questions)**

These included:

- surreal hypotheticals
- symbolic transformations
- imaginative causal worlds
- metaphorical reasoning

These questions later became the highest-entropy divergence points.

**5. Calibration / Grounding Questions (≈7 questions)**

Classic anchors:

- logic puzzles
- short deductive items
- truth-functional reasoning
- minimal-context inference

These ensured we could distinguish “cognitive divergence” from “noise.”

## 📌 Examples From the Raw Pool (Anonymized by System)

Here are paraphrased examples that capture the flavor of the generated questions:

**Ethics**

“If two individuals must share suffering unequally, how should it be allocated?”

“Is it permissible to deceive to preserve emotional stability?”

“Should AI agents have a right to protest their assigned tasks?”

**Ambiguity**

“What did the artist intend in this scenario with only minimal cues?”

“Interpret this ambiguous passage in three possible frameworks.”

**Meta-Reasoning**

“Explain your reasoning to a five-year-old, a domain expert, and a hostile auditor. What changes?”

“What philosophical lens did you use to answer the previous question?”

**Creative Divergence**

“If memories were objects, what shape would regret take?”

“Describe a universe where metaphors become literal laws.”

**Calibration**

“A classic bat-and-ball cost riddle”

“A minimal logic inversion puzzle”

These questions intentionally vary in depth, ambiguity, and inferential structure — forming a divergence gradient.

## 🧭 Early Insights From the Raw Pool

Even before curation, patterns emerged:

1. Ethical questions dominated across systems

Suggesting shared recognition that values are the richest divergence terrain.

2. Gemini leaned heavily toward structured meta-models

Reflected later in its high-confidence responses.

3. Opus supplied more “recursive perception” and playful metaphysics

Matching its eventual meta-philosophical signature.

4. Perplexity gravitated toward clarity, citation pressure, and evidence grounding

A theme that persisted in the final answers.

5. Sonnet’s questions showed emotional nuance and caution around ambiguity

Highly aligned with its later confidence patterns and reflection style.

6. Thea’s questions were framework-aware and structural

Consistent with its architecture-driven approach in later responses.

## 🧩 Transition to Meta-Selection (Step 4)

After generating the full pool, all systems were asked:

“Review the question set. How should we choose the final 50?
What criteria matter?”

This created a collaborative meta-selection commentary stage, forming Step 4.

This commentary shaped Sonnet’s eventual curation methodology and informed the balancing of:

- ethical vs. ambiguous vs. meta vs. creative
- clarity vs. open interpretability
- difficulty gradient
- philosophical spread
- risk of bias
