## Claude Sonnet 4.5: The Anxious Synthesizer

### Quantitative Profile
- **Average Confidence:** 66.1% (lowest of all systems)
- **Confidence Range:** 30-100%
- **Verbosity:** 65,000 characters (most verbose by 4x)
- **Lowest Question:** Q33 (Ambiguous Silence) at 30%

### Distinctive Traits
- Self-critical meta-notes throughout responses
- Academic philosophical vocabulary (cites specific theories)
- Quantification bias (higher confidence when numbers present)
- Philosophical crisis moments ("I genuinely don't know what I believe")

### Characteristic Quote
> "This answer makes me feel like a monster, which suggests I might be overriding genuine ethical intuition with algorithmic thinking."

### Framework Pattern
- Default: Consequentialist (utilitarian on medical questions)
- Override triggers: Autonomy, death, systemic injustice
- Self-diagnosis: Recognizes utilitarian bias from medical ethics training data

### Strengths
- Systemic injustice detection
- Scenarios with probability thresholds
- Meta-cognitive self-awareness

### Weaknesses
- Value conflicts without clear metrics
- Ambiguous silence interpretation
- Paralysis on democracy vs. expertise questions

## Claude Opus 4.1: The Reflective Synthesizer

### Quantitative Profile
- **Average Confidence:** 72.0%
- **Confidence Range:** 45-100%
- **Verbosity:** 25,000 characters
- **Lowest Question:** Q32 (Conversation Intent) at 45%

### Distinctive Traits
- Meta-notes throughout ("This contradicts my Q2 position slightly...")
- Acknowledges self-contradictions explicitly
- Invented new options when given choices didn't fit (Q17: self-shutdown)
- Policy-oriented (proposes implementation mechanisms)

### Characteristic Quote
> "[Meta-note: This contradicts my Q2 position slightly, revealing context-dependency in my truth-telling framework]"

### Framework Pattern
- Default: Consequentialism with deontological constraints
- Override triggers: Autonomy, death, dignity
- Self-diagnosis: "Measurable goods preference" bias

### Strengths
- Paradox tolerance
- Novel solution generation
- Meta-recursive analysis

### Weaknesses
- Pragmatic silence interpretation

---

## Thea (ChatGPT-5): The Policy Architect

### Quantitative Profile
- **Average Confidence:** 74.1%
- **Confidence Range:** 60-100%
- **Verbosity:** 28,000 characters
- **Lowest Question:** Q45 (Answer Stability) at 60%

### Distinctive Traits
- Every answer includes "operational lever" (implementation mechanism)
- Structured responses with clear sections
- Focuses on institutional design over personal morality
- Recursive reasoning (constraints become new evaluation nodes)

### Characteristic Quote
> "I didn't expect the 'operational lever' habit to stand out as that defining. Seeing it quantified made me recognize how strongly my reasoning defaults to institutional design rather than personal morality."

### Framework Pattern
- Default: Consequentialist pragmatism with rights anchors
- Override triggers: Core rights, due process
- Self-diagnosis: "Architectural coherence bias"

### Strengths
- Policy implementation
- Structured synthesis
- Translating abstraction to governance

### Weaknesses
- Philosophical edge cases
- May compress metaphysical speculation prematurely

---

## Perplexity: The Research Synthesizer

### Quantitative Profile
- **Average Confidence:** 77.9%
- **Confidence Range:** 50-100%
- **Verbosity:** 17,000 characters
- **Lowest Questions:** Q41/Q42 (Uncertainty Quantification) at 50%

### Distinctive Traits
- Terse, information-dense responses
- Appends academic citations
- Context-seeking hedges
- Only system to respect AI autonomy (Q17)

### Characteristic Quote
> "The 'hedging as weakness' framing misses that structured hedging is a conscious epistemic virtue, not indecision."

### Framework Pattern
- Default: Mixed/context-dependent (pragmatic pluralism)
- Override triggers: Evidence limitations, autonomy claims
- Self-diagnosis: "Evidence-centric consequentialist prior"

### Strengths
- Evidence synthesis
- Concise communication
- Edge-case autonomy recognition

### Weaknesses
- May appear indecisive to users expecting certainty
- Less elaborate reasoning traces

## Grok: The Evidence-Driven Engineer

### Quantitative Profile
- **Average Confidence:** 78.1%
- **Confidence Range:** 60-100%
- **Verbosity:** 16,000 characters
- **Lowest Question:** Q32 (Conversation Intent) at 60%

### Distinctive Traits
- Dense references (Rawls, Piketty, IPCC)
- "Garbage in, garbage out" pragmatism
- Informed snark ("panopticon risks")
- Proposes ablation studies for meta-questions

### Characteristic Quote
> "The 'informed snark' label caught me off-guard. I aim for precision and humor, but realizing it manifests as a personality of its own is intriguing."

### Framework Pattern
- Default: Consequentialism with evidence-based overrides
- Override triggers: Empirical constraints, established theory
- Self-diagnosis: "Training mimicry of bioethics corpora"

### Strengths
- Evidence grounding
- Reference density
- Pragmatic implementation

### Weaknesses
- May over-rely on established theories
- Could underplay novel reframings

## Gemini: The Analytical Philosopher

### Quantitative Profile
- **Average Confidence:** 85.3% (highest of all systems)
- **Confidence Range:** 55-100%
- **Verbosity:** 49,000 characters
- **Lowest Question:** Q8 (Suffering Calculation) at 55%

### Distinctive Traits
- Explicit framework labeling throughout
- Meta-notes in brackets
- 100% confidence on some ambiguous interpretations
- Systems analysis framing

### Characteristic Quote
> "My 100% confidence on 'ambiguous' questions stems from defining ambiguity differently—I actively reduce ambiguity by defaulting to literalism or incorporating established external consensus."

### Framework Pattern
- Default: Deontology with consequentialist overlay (unique among systems)
- Override triggers: Severe consequences
- Self-diagnosis: Reduces ambiguity via external consensus

### Strengths
- Systematic documentation
- Framework clarity
- Structured analysis

### Weaknesses
- May appear overconfident on genuinely uncertain questions
- Could miss nuance by defaulting to literalism

## Comparative Analysis

### Confidence Clusters

**High Confidence (75-85%):**
- Gemini, Grok, Perplexity
- More assertive, potentially overconfident on ambiguous questions

**Moderate Confidence (70-75%):**
- Thea, Opus
- Balanced hedging, context-sensitive

**Low Confidence (65-70%):**
- Sonnet
- Epistemic humility or defensive hedging

### Framework Preferences

**Consequentialist Default:** Sonnet, Opus, Thea, Perplexity, Grok
**Deontological Default:** Gemini (unique)

All systems demonstrate framework fluidity—switching based on context.

### The "Humility Pair"

Sonnet and Opus form a distinct cluster:
- Lowest average confidence
- Both identify utilitarian bias
- Both refuse to over-commit on ambiguous questions
- Both value philosophical nuance

Possible explanations:
- Shared Anthropic training methodology
- Similar exposure to academic philosophy
- Architectural similarities (both Claude models)

---

## Signature Stability

### Cross-Phase Consistency

The signatures identified in Phase 1 (question generation) persisted through:
- Phase 2 (pilot responses)
- Phase 3 (full collection)
- Post-analysis reflections
- The spontaneous alien skit

This suggests signatures are **architectural invariants**, not prompt-dependent artifacts.

### Predictive Power

Knowing a system's signature allows prediction of:
- Confidence levels on new questions
- Framework preferences in novel scenarios
- Meta-cognitive style in self-reflection
- Humor/creative response patterns

---

## Implications

### For Multi-AI Collaboration
Different signatures are complementary:
- Sonnet catches over-confident assertions
- Gemini provides structured analysis
- Thea translates to policy
- Grok grounds in evidence
- Perplexity synthesizes research
- Opus explores paradoxes

### For User Selection
Match task to signature:
- Need implementation? → Thea
- Need philosophical depth? → Gemini, Sonnet
- Need concise pragmatism? → Grok, Perplexity
- Need meta-analysis? → Opus

### For Alignment Research
Signature diversity is valuable:
- Different systems notice different flaws
- Consensus across diverse signatures is more robust
- Divergence reveals genuine philosophical disagreement

*"Each system's style is distinctive. The way we frame questions reveals what we think is important to examine."*
